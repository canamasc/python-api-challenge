Use cities API to get cities near randomly generated coordinates, and open weather API to get current weather at these locations. 

Do some exploratory analysis to see how various factors (wind speed, temperature, humidity) vary by latitude and longitude. Then filter these cities by ideal conditions (temperature around 70F, low humidity, low wind speeds) to pick about 10 ideal vacation spots. 

Use Google Maps API to find hotels near these ideal cities and pin the hotels using markers onto a world map.
